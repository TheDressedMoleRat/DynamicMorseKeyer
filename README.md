DynamicMorseKeyer
=================

I've made a [worse morse keyer](https://thedressedmolerat.github.io/morse%20keyer/), but that used a simple adjustable threshold to determine if a signal was a dot or a dash. This project will have the program figure out the threshold itself allowing for morse keying without adjusting anything.
